CRITICAL: Never commit credentials, API keys, or secrets to git.
Never hardcode credentials in source code or config files.
Verify that `.gitignore` excludes: `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `gcloud-*.json`, `service-account-*.json`, `aws-credentials.json`, `.env`, `.env.*` (except `.env.example`), `secrets/`, `.aws/`, `.gcloud/`, `.azure/`, `terraform.tfstate`, `terraform.tfstate.backup`.
Use cloud-native secret management: Google Cloud Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, or OpenShift Sealed Secrets.
Use Workload Identity or IAM roles instead of service account keys.
Store API keys in secret managers and inject as environment variables.
Always use deployment scripts in `deployment/{gcp,aws,openshift}/` for deployments.
Review security sections in relevant ADRs before making changes.
Test with least-privilege IAM policies first.
Enable cloud provider security scanning (Cloud Security Command Center, AWS Security Hub, etc.).
