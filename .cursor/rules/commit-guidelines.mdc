Follow Conventional Commits style: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor(scope): summary`.
Reference issue numbers when relevant in commit messages.
Keep commit subjects under 72 characters.
Include in PRs: 1) a concise problem statement, 2) before/after behavior or performance notes, 3) instructions for reproducing test runs.
Attach updated screenshots or logs when touching developer experience flows in PRs.
Confirm the file watcher still transitions to "active" in manual smoke tests for PRs.
Run `uv run pytest` before submitting PRs.
Run `uv run code-index-mcp` before submitting PRs to verify local mode works.
Examples of valid commit messages: `feat: add semantic search support`, `fix: resolve file watcher debounce issue`, `refactor(indexing): optimize tree-sitter parsing`.
