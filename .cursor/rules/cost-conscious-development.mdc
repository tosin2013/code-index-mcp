When adding cloud features, consider if the service can scale-to-zero (run on-demand only).
When adding cloud features, ensure unused resources will be cleaned up automatically.
When adding cloud features, document monthly cost impact in the relevant ADR.
When adding cloud features, recommend setting up cost monitoring and budget alerts.
Verify that cleanup automation is implemented (Cloud Scheduler, EventBridge, CronJob).
Test auto-cleanup logic with mock data before production deployment.
Include cost estimates in ADRs: idle cost, light usage cost, production usage cost.
Consider serverless options (Cloud Run, Lambda) over always-on services when possible.
Implement lifecycle rules for cloud storage (archive after 30 days, delete after 90 days).
Use auto-scaling with appropriate min/max replica counts.
