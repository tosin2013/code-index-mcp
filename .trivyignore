# Cloud Run Job Security Context False Positive
# KSV-0118: Cloud Run uses run.googleapis.com/v1 API with its own security model
# The check expects standard Kubernetes batch/v1 format
# Security contexts ARE configured (both pod-level and container-level)
# but Trivy's K8s scanner doesn't recognize Cloud Run's YAML format
