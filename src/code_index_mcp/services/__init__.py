"""
Service layer for the Code Index MCP server.

This package contains domain-specific services that handle the business logic
for different areas of functionality:

- ProjectService: Project initialization and configuration management
- IndexService: Index building, management, and file discovery
- SearchService: Code search operations and search tool management
- FileService: File operations, content retrieval, and analysis
- SettingsService: Settings management and directory operations

Each service follows a consistent pattern:
- Constructor accepts MCP Context parameter
- Methods correspond to MCP entry points
- Clear domain boundaries with no cross-service dependencies
- Shared utilities accessed through utils module
- Meaningful exceptions raised for error conditions
